# AlphaZero-like Algorithm for Reasoning and Knowledge Retrieval with LMs

## Overview

This project implements an AlphaZero-like algorithm designed to enhance reasoning and knowledge retrieval in language models (LMs). Our primary focus is on scientific hypothesis validation, where the algorithm will rigorously evaluate hypotheses for plausibility, originality, and potential impact using a comprehensive scientific literature database.

## Features

- **Advanced Reasoning**: Leverage cutting-edge techniques to boost LM reasoning capabilities.
- **Efficient Knowledge Retrieval**: Access and retrieve relevant information from extensive scientific literature.
- **Thorough Hypothesis Evaluation**: Assess hypotheses based on key scientific criteria.
